# Sketch-Pad
This was the last assignment from my Intermediate Java Programming class. The main programs were mostly written by my professor, but the MyPoly class which the program is based on was written by me. This program acts as a sketch pad in which the user may draw, fill, highlight, delete, etc. different shapes and polygons.
